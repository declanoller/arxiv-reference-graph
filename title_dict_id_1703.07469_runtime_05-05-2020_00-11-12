It has been addressed using neural networks too, in particular by\nNeural Turing Machines (NTMs). These are fully differentiable computers that\nuse backpropagation to learn their own programming. Despite their appeal NTMs\nhave a weakness that is caused by their sequential nature: they are not parallel and\nare are hard to train due to their large depth when unfolded.\nWe present a neural network architecture to address this problem: the Neural\nGPU. It is based on a type of convolutional gated recurrent unit and, like the\nNTM, is computationally universal. Unlike the NTM, the Neural GPU is highly\nparallel which makes it easier to train and efficient to run.\nAn essential property of algorithms is their ability to handle inputs of arbitrary\nsize. We show that the Neural GPU can be trained on short instances of an algorithmic task and successfully generalize to long instances. We verified it on a\nnumber of tasks including long addition and long multiplication of numbers represented in binary. We train the Neural GPU on numbers with up-to 20 bits and\nobserve no errors whatsoever while testing it, even on much longer numbers.\nTo achieve these results we introduce a technique for training deep recurrent networks: parameter sharing relaxation. We also found a small amount of dropout\nand gradient noise to have a large positive effect on learning and generalization.\n\n1\n\nI NTRODUCTION\n\nDeep neural networks have recently proven successful at various tasks, such as computer vision\n(Krizhevsky et al., 2012), speech recognition (Dahl et al., 2012), and in other domains. Recurrent\nneural networks based on long short-term memory (LSTM) cells (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997)\nhave been successfully applied to a number of natural language processing tasks. Sequence-tosequence recurrent neural networks with such cells can learn very complex tasks in an end-to-end\nmanner, such as translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014), parsing\n(Vinyals & Kaiser et al., 2015), speech recognition (Chan et al., 2016) or image caption generation\n(Vinyals et al., 2014). Since so many tasks can be solved with essentially one model, a natural\nquestion arises: is this model the best we can hope for in supervised learning?\nDespite its recent success, the sequence-to-sequence model has limitations. In its basic form, the\nentire input is encoded into a single fixed-size vector, so the model cannot generalize to inputs much\nlonger than this fixed capacity. One way to resolve this problem is by using an attention mechanism\n(Bahdanau et al., 2014). This allows the network to inspect arbitrary parts of the input in every decoding step, so the basic limitation is removed. But other problems remain, and Joulin & Mikolov\n(2015) show a number of basic algorithmic tasks on which sequence-to-sequence LSTM networks\nfail to generalize. They propose a stack-augmented recurrent network, and it works on some problems, but is limited in other ways.\nIn the best case one would desire a neural network model able to learn arbitrarily complex algorithms\ngiven enough resources. Neural Turing Machines (Graves et al., 2014) have this theoretical property.\nHowever, they are not computationally efficient because they use soft attention and because they tend\nto be of considerable depth. Their depth makes the training objective difficult to optimize and impossible to parallelize because they are learning a sequential program. Their use of soft attention\nrequires accessing the entire memory in order to simulate 1 step of computation, which introduces\nsubstantial overhead. These two factors make learning complex algorithms using Neural Turing Ma1\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2016\n\nchines difficult. These issues are not limited to Neural Turing Machines, they apply to other architectures too, such as stack-RNNs (Joulin & Mikolov, 2015) or (De)Queue-RNNs (Grefenstette et al.,\n2015). One can try to alleviate these problems using hard attention and reinforcement learning, but\nsuch non-differentiable models do not learn well at present (Zaremba & Sutskever, 2015b).\nIn this work we present a neural network model, the Neural GPU, that addresses the above issues.\nIt is a Turing-complete model capable of learning arbitrary algorithms in principle, like a Neural\nTuring Machine. But, in contrast to Neural Turing Machines, it is designed to be as parallel and as\nshallow as possible. It is more similar to a GPU than to a Turing machine since it uses a smaller number of parallel computational steps. We show that the Neural GPU works in multiple experiments:\n\u2022 A Neural GPU can learn long binary multiplication from examples. It is the first neural\nnetwork able to learn an algorithm whose run-time is superlinear in the size of its input.\nTrained on up-to 20-bit numbers, we see no single error on any inputs we tested, and we\ntested on numbers up-to 2000 bits long.\n\u2022 The same architecture can also learn long binary addition and a number of other algorithmic tasks, such as counting, copying sequences, reversing them, or duplicating them.\n1.1\n\nR ELATED W ORK\n\nThe learning of algorithms with neural networks has seen a lot of interest after the success\nof sequence-to-sequence neural networks on language processing tasks (Sutskever et al., 2014;\nBahdanau et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014). An attempt has even been made to learn to evaluate simple python programs with a pure sequence-to-sequence model (Zaremba & Sutskever, 2015a), but\nmore success was seen with more complex models. Neural Turing Machines (Graves et al., 2014)\nwere shown to learn a number of basic sequence transformations and memory access patterns, and\ntheir reinforcement learning variant (Zaremba & Sutskever, 2015b) has reasonable performance on\na number of tasks as well. Stack, Queue and DeQueue networks (Grefenstette et al., 2015) were also\nshown to learn basic sequence transformations such as bigram flipping or sequence reversal.\nThe Grid LSTM (Kalchbrenner et al., 2016) is another powerful architecture that can learn to multiply 15-digit decimal numbers. As we will see in the next section, the Grid-LSTM is quite similar\nto the Neural GPU \u2013 the main difference is that the Neural GPU is less recurrent and is explicitly\nconstructed from the highly parallel convolution operator.\nIn image processing, convolutional LSTMs, an architecture similar to the Neural GPU, have recently\nbeen used for weather prediction (Shi et al., 2015) and image compression (Toderici et al., 2016).\nWe find it encouraging as it hints that the Neural GPU might perform well in other contexts.\nMost comparable to this work are the prior experiments with the stack-augmented RNNs\n(Joulin & Mikolov, 2015). These networks manage to learn and generalize to unseen lengths on\na number of algorithmic tasks. But, as we show in Section 3.1, stack-augmented RNNs trained to\nadd numbers up-to 20-bit long generalize only to \u223c 100-bit numbers, never to 200-bit ones, and\nnever without error. Still, their generalization is the best we were able to obtain without using the\nNeural GPU and far surpasses a baseline LSTM sequence-to-sequence model with attention.\nThe quest for learning algorithms has been pursued much more widely with tools other than neural networks. It is known under names such as program synthesis, program induction, automatic\nprogramming, or inductive synthesis, and has a long history with many works that we do not cover\nhere; see, e.g., Gulwani (2010) and Kitzelmann (2010) for a more general perspective.\nSince one of our results is the synthesis of an algorithm for long binary addition, let us recall how\nthis problem has been addressed without neural networks. Importantly, there are two cases of this\nproblem with different complexity. The easier case is when the two numbers that are to be added\nare aligned at input, i.e., if the first (lower-endian) bit of the first number is presented at the same\ntime as the first bit of the second number, then come the second bits, and so on, as depicted below\nfor x = 9 = 8 + 1 and y = 5 = 4 + 1 written in binary with least-significant bit left.\nInput\n(x and y aligned)\nDesired Output (x + y)\n2\n\n1\n1\n0\n\n0\n0\n1\n\n0\n1\n1\n\n1\n0\n1\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2016\n\nIn this representation the triples of bits from (x, y, x + y), e.g., (1, 1, 0) (0, 0, 1) (0, 1, 1) (1, 0, 1)\nas in the figure above, form a regular language. To learn binary addition in this representation it\ntherefore suffices to find a regular expression or an automaton that accepts this language, which can\nbe done with a variant of Anguin\u2019s algorithm (Angluin, 1987). But only few interesting functions\nhave regular representations, as for example long multiplication does not (Blumensath & Gra\u0308del,\n2000). It is therefore desirable to learn long binary addition without alignment, for example when x\nand y are provided one after another. This is the representation we use in the present paper.\nInput (x, y)\nDesired Output (x + y)\n\n2\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n1\n\n0\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n+\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\nT HE N EURAL GPU\n\nBefore we introduce the Neural GPU, let us recall the architecture of a Gated Recurrent Unit\n(GRU) (Cho et al., 2014). A GRU is similar to an LSTM, but its input and state are the same\nsize, which makes it easier for us to generalize it later; a highway network could have also been\nused (Srivastava et al., 2015), but it lacks the reset gate. GRUs have shown performance similar to\nLSTMs on a number of tasks (Chung et al., 2014; Greff et al., 2015). A GRU takes an input vector\nx and a current state vector s, and outputs:\nGRU(x, s) = u \u2299 s + (1 \u2212 u) \u2299 tanh(W x + U (r \u2299 s) + B), where\nu = \u03c3(W \u2032 x + U \u2032 s + B \u2032 )\n\nand r = \u03c3(W \u2032\u2032 x + U \u2032\u2032 s + B \u2032\u2032 ).\n\nIn the equations above, W, W \u2032 , W \u2032\u2032 , U, U \u2032 , U \u2032\u2032 are matrices and B, B \u2032 , B \u2032\u2032 are bias vectors; these\nare the parameters that will be learned. We write W x for a matrix-vector multiplication and r \u2299 s\nfor elementwise vector multiplication. The vectors u and r are called gates since their elements are\nin [0, 1] \u2014 u is the update gate and r is the reset gate.\nIn recurrent neural networks a unit like GRU is applied at every step and the result is both passed as\nnew state and used to compute the output. In a Neural GPU we do not process a new input in every\nstep. Instead, all inputs are written into the starting state s0 . This state has 2-dimensional structure:\nit consists of w \u00d7 h vectors of m numbers, i.e., it is a 3-dimensional tensor of shape [w, h, m]. This\nmental image evolves in time in a way defined by a convolutional gated recurrent unit:\nCGRU(s) = u \u2299 s + (1 \u2212 u) \u2299 tanh(U \u2217 (r \u2299 s) + B), where\nu = \u03c3(U \u2032 \u2217 s + B \u2032 ) and r = \u03c3(U \u2032\u2032 \u2217 s + B \u2032\u2032 ).\nU \u2217 s above denotes the convolution of a kernel bank U with the mental image s. A kernel bank is a\n4-dimensional tensor of shape [kw , kh , m, m], i.e., it contains kw \u00b7 kh \u00b7 m2 parameters, where kw and\nkh are kernel width and height. It is applied to a mental image s of shape [w, h, m] which results in\nanother mental image U \u2217 s of the same shape defined by:\nX\n\n\u230akw /2\u230b\n\nU \u2217 s[x, y, i] =\n\nX\n\n\u230akh /2\u230b\n\nm\nX\n\ns[x + u, y + v, c] \u00b7 U [u, v, c, i].\n\nu=\u230a\u2212kw /2\u230b v=\u230a\u2212kh /2\u230b c=1\n\nIn the equation above the index x + u might sometimes be negative or larger than the size of s, and\nin such cases we assume the value is 0. This corresponds to the standard convolution operator used\nin convolutional neural networks with zero padding on both sides and stride 1. Using the standard\noperator has the advantage that it is heavily optimized (see Section 4 for Neural GPU performance).\nNew work on faster convolutions, e.g., Lavin & Gray (2015), can be directly used in a Neural GPU.\nKnowing how a CGRU gate works, the definition of a l-layer Neural GPU is simple, as depicted in\nFigure 1. The given sequence i = (i1 , . . . , in ) of n discrete symbols from {0, . . . , I} is first embedded into the mental image s0 by concatenating the vectors obtained from an embedding lookup\nof the input symbols into its first column. More precisely, we create the starting mental image s0 of\nshape [w, n, m] by using an embedding matrix E of shape [I, m] and setting s0 [0, k, :] = E[ik ] (in\npython notation) for all k = 1 . . . n (here i1 , . . . , in is the input). All other elements of s0 are set to\n0. Then, we apply l different CGRU gates in turn for n steps to produce the final mental image sfin :\nst+1 = CGRUl (CGRUl\u22121 . . . CGRU1 (st ) . . .) and sfin = sn .\n3\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2016\n\no1\n\ni1\n\n..\n.\n\nCGRU1\n\n...\n\nCGRU2\n\nCGRU1\n\n..\n.\n\nCGRU2\n\non\n\nin\nsn\u22121\n\ns1\n\ns0\n\nsn\n\nFigure 1: Neural GPU with 2 layers and width w = 3 unfolded in time.\nThe result of a Neural GPU is produced by multiplying each item in the first column of sfin by\nan output matrix O to obtain the logits lk = Osfin [0, k, :] and then selecting the maximal one:\nok = argmax(lk ). During training we use the standard loss function, i.e., we compute a softmax\nover the logits lk and use the negative log probability of the target as the loss.\nSince all components of a Neural GPU are clearly differentiable, we can train using any stochastic\ngradient descent optimizer. For the results presented in this paper we used the Adam optimizer\n(Kingma & Ba, 2014) with \u03b5 = 10\u22124 and gradients norm clipped to 1. The number of layers was\nset to l = 2, the width of mental images was constant at w = 4, the number of maps in each mental\nimage point was m = 24, and the convolution kernels width and height was always kw = kh = 3.\nComputational power of Neural GPUs. While the above definition is simple, it might not be\nimmediately obvious what kind of functions a Neural GPU can compute. Why can we expect it to\nbe able to perform long multiplication? To answer such questions it is useful to draw an analogy\nbetween a Neural GPU and a discrete 2-dimensional cellular automaton. Except for being discrete\nand the lack of a gating mechanism, such automata are quite similar to Neural GPUs. Of course,\nthese are large exceptions. Dense representations have often more capacity than purely discrete\nstates and the gating mechanism is crucial to avoid vanishing gradients during training. But the\ncomputational power of cellular automata is much better understood. In particular, it is well known\nthat a cellular automaton can exploit its parallelism to multiply two n-bit numbers in O(n) steps\nusing Atrubin\u2019s algorithm. We recommend the online book (Vivien, 2003) to get an understanding\nof this algorithm and the computational power of cellular automata.\n\n3\n\nE XPERIMENTS\n\nIn this section, we present experiments showing that a Neural GPU can successfully learn a number\nof algorithmic tasks and generalize well beyond the lengths that it was trained on. We start with the\ntwo tasks we focused on, long binary addition and long binary multiplication. Then, to demonstrate\nthe generality of the model, we show that Neural GPUs perform well on several other tasks as well.\n3.1\n\nA DDITION\n\nAND\n\nM ULTIPLICATION\n\nThe two core tasks on which we study the performance of Neural GPUs are long binary addition\nand long binary multiplication. We chose them because they are fundamental tasks and because\nthere is no known linear-time algorithm for long multiplication. As described in Section 2, we\ninput a sequence of discrete symbols into the network and we read out a sequence of symbols\nagain. For binary addition, we use a set of 4 symbols: {0, 1, +, PAD} and for multiplication we use\n{0, 1, \u00b7, PAD}. The PAD symbol is only used for padding so we depict it as empty space below.\nLong binary addition (badd) is the task of adding two numbers represented lower-endian in\nbinary notation. We always add numbers of the same length, but we allow them to have 0s at start,\nso numbers of differing lengths can be padded to equal size. Given two d-bit numbers the full\nsequence length is n = 2d + 1, as seen in the example below, representing (1 + 4) + (2 + 4 + 8) =\n5 + 14 = 19 = (16 + 2 + 1).\n4\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2016\n\nTask@Bits\nbadd@20\nbadd@25\nbadd@100\nbadd@200\nbadd@2000\nbmul@20\nbmul@25\nbmul@200\nbmul@2000\n\nNeural GPU\n100%\n100%\n100%\n100%\n100%\n100%\n100%\n100%\n100%\n\nstackRNN\n100%\n100%\n88%\n0%\n0%\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n\nLSTM+A\n100%\n73%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n\nTable 1: Neural GPU, stackRNN, and LSTM+A results on addition and multiplication.

Again, we always multiply numbers of the same length, but we allow them to have 0s\nat start, so numbers of differing lengths can be padded to equal size. Given two d-bit numbers, the\nfull sequence length is again n = 2d+1, as seen in the example below, representing (2+4)\u00b7(2+8) =\n6 \u00b7 10 = 60 = 32 + 16 + 8 + 4.\nInput\nOutput\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n0\n1\n\n\u00b7\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nModels. We compare three different models on the above tasks. In addition to the Neural GPU\nwe include a baseline LSTM recurrent neural network with an attention mechanism. We call this\nmodel LSTM+A as it is exactly the same as described in (Vinyals & Kaiser et al., 2015). It is a\n3-layer model with 64 units in each LSTM cell in each layer, which results in about 200k parameters (the Neural GPU uses m = 24 and has about 30k paramters). Both the Neural GPU and\nthe LSTM+A baseline were trained using all the techniques described below, including curriculum\ntraining and gradient noise. Finally, on binary addition, we also include the stack-RNN model from\n(Joulin & Mikolov, 2015). This model was not trained using our training regime, but in exactly the\nway as provided in its source code, only with nmax = 41. To match our training procedure, we ran\nit 729 times (cf. Section 3.3) with different random seeds and we report the best obtained result.\nResults. We measure also the rate of fully correct output sequences and report the results in Table 1. For both tasks, we show first the error at the maximum length seen during training, i.e., for\n20-bit numbers. Note that LSTM+A is not able to learn long binary multiplication at this length, it\ndoes not even fit the training data. Then we report numbers for sizes not seen during training.\nAs you can see, a Neural GPU can learn a multiplication algorithm that generalizes perfectly, at least\nas far as we were able to test (technical limits of our implementation prevented us from testing much\nabove 2000 bits). Even for the simpler task of binary addition, stack-RNNs work only up-to length\n100. This is still much better than the LSTM+A baseline which only generalizes to length 25.\n3.2\n\nOTHER A LGORITHMIC TASKS\n\nIn addition to the two main tasks above, we tested Neural GPUs on the following simpler algorithmic\ntasks. The same architecture as used above was able to solve all of the tasks described below, i.e.,\nafter being trained on sequences of length up-to 41 we were not able to find any error on sequences\non any length we tested (up-to 4001).\nCopying sequences is the simple task of producing on output the same sequence as on input. It is\nvery easy for a Neural GPU, in fact all models converge quickly and generalize perfectly.\nReversing sequences is the task of reversing a sequence of bits, n is the length of the sequence.\n5\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2016\n\nDuplicating sequences is the task of duplicating the input bit sequence on output twice, as in the\nexample below. We use the padding symbol on input to make it match the output length. We trained\non sequences of inputs up-to 20 bits, so outputs were up-to 40-bits long, and tested on inputs up-to\n2000 bits long.\nInput\nOutput\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\nCounting by sorting bits is the task of sorting the input bit sequence on output. Since there are\nonly 2 symbols to sort, this is a counting tasks \u2013 the network must count how many 0s are in the\ninput and produce the output accordingly, as in the example below.\nInput\nOutput\n3.3\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n1\n\n0\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n0\n1\n\nT RAINING T ECHNIQUES\n\nHere we describe the training methods that we used to improve our results. Note that we applied\nthese methods to the LSTM+A baseline as well, to keep the above comparison fair. We focus on\nthe most important elements of our training regime, all less relevant details can be found in the code\nwhich is released as open-source.1\nGrid search. Each result we report is obtained by running a grid search over 36 = 729 instances.\nWe consider 3 settings of the learning rate, initial parameters scale, and 4 other hyperparameters\ndiscussed below: the relaxation pull factor, curriculum progress threshold, gradient noise scale, and\ndropout. An important effect of running this grid search is also that we train 729 models with different random seeds every time. Usually only a few of these models generalize to 2000-bit numbers,\nbut a significant fraction works well on 200-bit numbers, as discussed below.\nCurriculum learning. We use a curriculum learning approach inspired by Zaremba & Sutskever\n(2015a). This means that we train, e.g., on 7-digit numbers only after crossing a curriculum progress\nthreshold (e.g., over 90% fully correct outputs) on 6-digit numbers. However, with 20% probability\nwe pick a minibatch of d-digit numbers with d chosen uniformly at random between 1 and 20.\nGradients noise. To improve training speed and stability we add noise to gradients in each training\nstep. Inspired by the schedule from Welling & Teh (2011), we add to gradients a noise drawn from\nthe normal distribution with mean 0 and variance inversely proportional to the square root of stepnumber (i.e., with standard deviation proportional to the 4-th root of step-number). We multiply this\nnoise by the gradient noise scale and, to avoid noise in converged models, we also multiply it by the\nfraction of non-fully-correct outputs (which is 0 for a perfect model).\nGate cutoff. In Section 2 we defined the gates in a CGRU using the sigmoid function, e.g., we\nwrote u = \u03c3(U \u2032 \u2217 s + B \u2032 ). Usually the standard sigmoid function is used, \u03c3(x) = 1+e1\u2212x . We\nfound that adding a hard threshold on the top and bottom helps slightly in our setting, so we use\n1.2\u03c3(x) \u2212 0.1 cut to the interval [0, 1], i.e., \u03c3 \u2032 (x) = max(0, min(1, 1.2\u03c3(x) \u2212 0.1)).\n3.3.1\n\nD ROPOUT\n\nON RECURRENT CONNECTIONS\n\nDropout is a widely applied technique for regularizing neural networks. But when applying it to\nrecurrent networks, it has been counter-productive to apply it on recurrent connections \u2013 it only\nworked when applied to the non-recurrent ones, as reported by Pham et al. (2014).\nSince a Neural GPU does not have non-recurrent connections it might seem that dropout will not\nbe useful for this architecture. Surprisingly, we found the contrary \u2013 it is useful and improves\ngeneralization. The key to using dropout effectively in this setting is to set a small dropout rate.\nWhen we run a grid search for dropout rates we vary them between 6%, 9%, and 13.5%, meaning\nthat over 85% of the values are always preserved. It turns out that even this small dropout has large\n1\n\nThe code is at https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/neural_gpu.\n\n6\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2016\n\neffect since we apply it to the whole mental image si in each step i. Presumably the network now\nlearns to include some redundancy in its internal representation and generalization benefits from it.\nWithout dropout we usually see only a few models from a 729 grid search generalize reasonably,\nwhile with dropout it is a much larger fraction and they generalize to higher lengths. In particular,\ndropout was necessary to train models for multiplication that generalize to 2000 bits.\n3.3.2\n\nPARAMETER SHARING\n\nRELAXATION .\n\nTo improve optimization of our deep network we use a relaxation technique for shared parameters\nwhich works as follows. Instead of training with parameters shared across time-steps we use r\nidentical sets of non-shared parameters (we often use r = 6, larger numbers work better but use\nmore memory). At time-step t of the Neural GPU we use the i-th set if t mod r = i.\nThe procedure described above relaxes the network, as it can now perform different operations in\ndifferent time-steps. Training becomes easier, but we now have r parameters instead of the single\nshared set we want. To unify them we add a term to the cost function representing the distance\nof each parameter from the average of this parameter in all the r sets. This term in the final cost\nfunction is multiplied by a scalar which we call the relaxation pull. If the relaxation pull is 0, the\nnetwork behaves as if the r parameter sets were separate, but when it is large, the cost forces the\nnetwork to unify the parameters across different set.\nDuring training, we gradually increase the relaxation pull. We start with a small value and every time\nthe curriculum makes progress, e.g., when the model performs well on 6-digit numbers, we multiply\nthe relaxation pull by a relaxation pull factor. When the curriculum reaches the maximal length we\naverage the parameters from all sets and continue to train with a single shared parameter set.\nThis method is crucial for learning multiplication. Without it, a Neural GPU with m = 24 has\ntrouble to even fit the training set, and the few models that manage to do it do not generalize. With\nrelaxation almost all models in our 729 runs manage to fit the training data.\n\n4\n\nD ISCUSSION\n\nWe prepared a video of the Neural GPU trained to solve the tasks mentioned above.2. It shows\nthe state in each step with values of \u22121 drawn in white, 1 in black, and other in gray. This gives\nan intuition how the Neural GPU solves the discussed problems, e.g., it is quite clear that for the\nduplication task the Neural GPU learned to move a part of the embedding downwards in each step.\nWhat did not work well? For one, using decimal inputs degrades performance. All tasks above can\neasily be formulated with decimal inputs instead of binary ones. One could hope that a Neural GPU\nwill work well in this case too, maybe with a larger m. We experimented with this formulation and\nour results were worse than when the representation was binary: we did not manage to learn long\ndecimal multiplication. Increasing m to 128 allows to learn all other tasks in the decimal setting.\nAnother problem is that often only a few models in a 729 grid search generalize to very long unseen\ninstances. Among those 729 models, there usually are many models that generalize to 40 or even 200\nbits, but only a few working without error for 2000-bit numbers. Using dropout and gradient noise\nimproves the reliability of training and generalization, but maybe another technique could help even\nmore. How could we make more models achieve good generalization? One idea that looks natural\nis to try to reduce the number of parameters by decreasing m. Surprisingly, this does not seem to\nhave any influence. In addition to the m = 24 results presented above we ran experiments with\nm = 32, 64, 128 and the results were similar. In fact using m = 128 we got the most models to\ngeneralize. Additionally, we observed that ensembling a few models, just by averaging their outputs,\nhelps to generalize: ensembles of 5 models almost always generalize perfectly on binary tasks.\nWhy use width? The Neural GPU is defined using two-dimensional convolutions and in our experiments one of the dimensions is always set to 4. Doing so is not necessary since a one-dimensional\nNeural GPU that uses four times larger m can represent every function representable by the original\none. In fact we trained a model for long binary multiplication that generalized to 2000-bit numbers\nusing a Neural GPU with width 1 and m = 64. However, the width of the Neural GPU increases the\n2\n\nThe video is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzC8NkTZAF4\n\n7\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2016\n\namount of information carried in its hidden state without increasing the number of its parameters.\nThus it can be thought of as a factorization and might be useful for other tasks.\nSpeed and data efficiency. Neural GPUs use the standard, heavily optimized convolution operation\nand are fast. We experimented with a 2-layer Neural GPU for n = 32 and m = 64. After unfolding\nin time it has 128 layers of CGRUs, each operating on 32 mental images, each 4 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 64 . The\njoint forward-backward step time for this network was about 0.6s on an NVIDIA GTX 970 GPU.\nWe were also surprised by how data-efficient a Neural GPU can be. The experiments presented\nabove were all performed using 10k random training data examples for each training length. Since\nwe train on up-to 20-bit numbers this adds to about 200k training examples. We tried to train using\nonly 100 examples per length, so about 2000 total training instances. We were surprised to see\nthat it actually worked well for binary addition: there were models that generalized well to 200-bit\nnumbers and to all lengths below despite such small training set. But we never managed to train a\ngood model for binary multiplication with that little training data.\n\n5\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nAND\n\nF UTURE WORK\n\nThe results presented in Table 1 show clearly that there is a qualitative difference between what can\nbe achieved with a Neural GPU and what was possible with previous architectures. In particular, for\nthe first time, we show a neural network that learns a non-trivial superlinear-time algorithm in a way\nthat generalized to much higher lengths without errors.\nThis opens the way to use neural networks in domains that were previously only addressed by\ndiscrete methods, such as program synthesis. With the surprising data efficiency of Neural GPUs it\ncould even be possible to replicate previous program synthesis results, e.g., Kaiser (2012), but in a\nmore scalable way. It is also interesting that a Neural GPU can learn symbolic algorithms without\nusing any discrete state at all, and adding dropout and noise only improves its performance.\nAnother promising future work is to apply Neural GPUs to language processing tasks. Good\nresults have already been obtained on translation with a convolutional architecture over words\n(Kalchbrenner & Blunsom, 2013) and adding gating and recursion, like in a Neural GPU, should\nallow to train much deeper models without overfitting. Finally, the parameter sharing relaxation\ntechnique can be applied to any deep recurrent network and has the potential to improve RNN training in general.\n\nR EFERENCES\nAngluin, Dana.
